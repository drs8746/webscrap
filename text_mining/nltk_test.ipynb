Established in 1930, the BIS is owned by 60 central banks, representing countries from around the world that together account for about 95% of world GDP. Its head office is in Basel, Switzerland and it has two representative offices: in Hong Kong SAR and in Mexico City.  We pursue our mission by:  fostering discussion and facilitating collaboration among central banks supporting dialogue with other authorities that are responsible for promoting financial stability carrying out research and policy analysis on issues of relevance for monetary and financial stability acting as a prime counterparty for central banks in their financial transactions serving as an agent or trustee in connection with international financial operations As part of our work in the area of monetary and financial stability, we regularly publish related analyses and international banking and financial statistics that underpin policymaking, academic research and public debate.  With regard to our banking activities, our customers are central banks and international organisations. We do not accept deposits from, or provide financial services to, private individuals or corporate entities.'"
